# WATSON: translate for me

This APP is a study of JSON/HTTP data retrieval using Watson API. After a quick search for API's at internet, i found IBM Watson and then i decided to use the translate api to create a translation Android APP, using the info retrieved from http request. I din't use authentication process decribed in the documentation, only the plain url.
